# FaseJS

## This is really cool
 
 **Fast ActionScript Emulation for JavaScript**
 
  * FaseJS seeks to create a dialect of javascript that will make it natural for AS3 programmers to transition into Web standards.
  * The project aims to be truly cross-browser under the hood, so users will only need to think about their creative goals.
  * The end product will be a compact js library that contains the FaseJS core and a collection of classes familiar to Flash developers for creating and manuipulating a DisplayList within the DOM.
